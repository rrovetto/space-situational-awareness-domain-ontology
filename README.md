## Description
The SSA ontology is an ontology of the space situational awareness (SSA) domain [2]. It offers a both (un)defined terminology for SSA concepts and objects. 

### Scope 
The scope of SSAO, and its domain, minimally includes that which affords awareness and knowledge of a given outer space environment, more notably the orbital and near-Earth space environment. As such, it provides a generic conceptual model applicable to any space environment, while also applicable to Earth. The scope includes: observation, detection, identification, tracking, re-identification, and propagation (prediction of future behavior/motion) activities of objects in orbit; and data thereof. In addition to these SSA activities, the SSA domain can be construed to extend to the objects (satellites) and events in orbit. Sub-domain ontologies can alternatively represent these entities for a more modular architecture, e.g., in an [Orbital Object Ontology](https://github.com/rrovetto/The-Orbital-Object-Ontology), [Orbital Event Ontology](https://github.com/rrovetto/orbital-event-ontology), etc. The relationships between these entities are also critical to fully capture the overall space domain [3][4]. 

### Architecture 
Various ontology architectures are under consideration. A self-contained module, usable by itself, but also part of the author's wider space domain knowledge modeling suite of ontologies and other knowledge organization systems.

The focus is awareness of orbital space surrounding Earth, toward ensuring safety and security of Earth and space-borne assetts (satellites, etc.). However, give the upper-level (more general/abstract) classification goal, the SSAO can be generalized to any central body. SSAO aims to formally and computationally represent the relationships between objects near Earth (or any planetary reference frame), and annotate orbital and other SSA instance data to facilitate data-sharing and integration among

### Purpose & Value
* To support SSA, space safety and sustainability
* To mitigate orbital debris hazards
* To innovate by exploring the utility of ontology and related systems to spaceflight and other space topics
* To facilitate content search and retrival
* ...
The overall project (http://purl.org/space-ontology) is to apply ontology to orbital data for various applications such as fostering data-sharing, integration among orbital debris, space object catalogues, and other SSA databases; automated reasoning, knowledge discovery and semantic and systems interoperability.

### Status
* In-progress as circumstances permit. Subject to revision. 
* As a unfunded personal project since inception, continued development is dependent on circumstances. Formal support is needed to complete and sustain development to realize the full project vision. The vision is ambitious, multidisciplinary and detailed. [Contact the author](https://ontospace.wordpress.com/contact) to formally support the project in some way. Donations are welcome at the below web-links.  
* ACTIVELY NEEDING: financial support, employer support, stable environment with resources to development and continue learning, etc.
* Desired as my PhD or other graduate project

## Support / Contribute / Desiderata - How you can help 
As an unfunded personal project, you can help by offerring financial support, employment opportunities, graduate study opportunities whereby this can be part of my thesis or projects, co-authorship on papers or proposal, mentorship, voluntary technical expertise/servies for desired functionalities of my project, relevant datasets to apply the ontology to, and to be a user of the ontology(s).

* With sufficient formal support, a version may become open. 

## Example Application
The SSAO has been used in an ontology oriented orrery project at NASA by Dr. D.A. O'Neil, presenting two 3D visualizaitons [1](http://daoneil.github.io/spacemission/OntologyDrivenOrrery/An_Orrery_in_ThreeJS.html) and [2](https://daoneil.github.io/spacemission/RMarkdown/ontology_based_orrery_generated_from_R_code.html)
