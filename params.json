It provides a defined terminology for SSA concepts and objects. The scope of SSAO, and its domain, minimally includes that which affords awareness and knowledge of the orbital and near-Earth space environment. This consists of observation, detection, identification, tracking, re-identification, and propagation (prediction of future behavior/motion) activities of objects in orbit. \r\n\r\nIn addition to these SSA activities, observations & measurements, and events in orbit & the orbital objects themselves must be ontologically represented. The relationships between these entities are also critical to fully capture the overall orbital space environment domain[3][4]. Ontology terms for these entities may constitute sub-domain space ontologies--such as the orbital debris ontology, the orbital event ontology, and so forth, each of which can be imported into the SSAO. Alternatively, such terms can be terms directly part of the SSAO. These ontology architectures are under consideration. \r\n\r\nThe overall project (http://purl.org/space-ontology) is to apply ontology to orbital data in order to foster data-sharing, integration among orbital debris, space object and other SSA databases; automated reasoning, knowledge discovery and semantic and systems interoperability.\r\n\r\nThe focus is awareness of orbital space surrounding Earth, toward ensuring safety and security of Earth and space-borne assetts (satellites, etc.). However, give the upper-level (more general/abstract) classification goal, the SSAO can be generalized to any central body. SSAO aims to formally and computationally represent the relationships between objects near Earth (or any planetary reference frame), and annotate orbital and other SSA instance data to facilitate data-sharing and integration among\r\n\r\n##Example Applications##\r\nThe SSAO has been used by an (ontology-driver orrery)[http://daoneil.github.io/spacemission/OntologyDrivenOrrery/An_Orrery_in_ThreeJS.html] project at NASA by [Dan O'Neil](https://github.com/daoneil/spacemission/tree/master/OntologyDrivenOrrery) that is under development.\r\n\r\n##Status##\r\n* Under development. Subject to revision. No claims to completeness are made. The name and scope of the ontology, and its relation to the authors other ontologies is subject to revision. \r\n\r\n* **SEEKING**funded opportunities and partners to sustainably development the SSAO\r\n* Professors interested in applying to grants with me should contact my email below.
